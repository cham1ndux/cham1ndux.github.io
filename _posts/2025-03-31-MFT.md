  alt: Uncovering Time Stomping in Windows: A Deep Dive into Anti-Forensics with NTFS
---

In the world of digital forensics, attackers are constantly trying to cover their tracks‚Äîand one subtle but powerful method they use is time stomping. It‚Äôs an anti-forensic technique designed to manipulate file timestamps, hiding the true timeline of malicious activity. But thanks to the structure of the NTFS file system, we as analysts can still find traces of deception‚Äîif we know where to look.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why Attackers Hide in System Folders

One of the most common places attackers try to hide malware is in the `C:\Windows\System32` folder or similar system directories. These locations are filled with legitimate binaries and DLLs that Windows relies on. Dropping malware in here helps it blend into the noise.

But this strategy has a weak point: file modification dates. Most legitimate files in this folder were last modified when Windows was installed or updated. So if a malicious file was added recently, it sticks out like a sore thumb‚Äîand that's exactly what analysts are trained to spot.

## üõ†Ô∏è What is Time Stomping?

To prevent detection, attackers change the timestamps of the malicious file‚Äîa technique known as time stomping. This involves altering the file‚Äôs creation, modification, and access timestamps to mimic legitimate system files.

This can be done easily in PowerShell using Windows API methods like this:

```powershell
$path = "C:\Windows\System32\mimikatz.exe"
(Get-Item $path).CreationTime = '01/01/2020 12:00:00'
(Get-Item $path).LastWriteTime = '01/01/2020 12:00:00'
(Get-Item $path).LastAccessTime = '01/01/2020 12:00:00'
```

With just a few lines of code, the file now looks like it's been there for years‚Äîeven if it was dropped on 2025.

## üß† The NTFS Advantage for Forensic Analysts

Here‚Äôs where NTFS (New Technology File System) gives us the upper hand.

NTFS stores multiple sets of timestamps across different attributes. These are the main ones to know:

- `STANDARD INFORMATION` ‚Äì Contains the timestamps used by Windows Explorer and most standard tools. This is what attackers usually modify.

- `FILE NAME` ‚Äì Contains a second, independent set of timestamps associated with the file name. These are much harder to spoof via standard API calls.

Even if an attacker changes the `STANDARD INFORMATION` timestamps, they usually leave behind discrepancies in the `FILE NAME` attribute.

## üîç Using the Master File Table (MFT) to Detect Time Stomping

The Master File Table (MFT) is a core structure in NTFS that tracks every file and folder on the volume. Each file has an MFT entry that contains metadata including both `STANDARD INFORMATION` and `FILE NAME` timestamps.

Here‚Äôs a practical approach to detect time stomping:

**#1 Extract the MFT from the target system using `Kape` tool**

**#2 Use a tool like `MFTECmd` by Eric Zimmerman to parse MFT entries.and export a timeline by converting the MFT to a bodyfile using `MFTECmd --body`.**

```powershell
MFTECmd.exe -f "C:\Users\Chamindu\Desktop\MFT\C\$MFT" --body C:\Users\Chamindu\Desktop\MFT\C --bodyf mft.body --blf --bdl C
```

<img src="/assets/img/mft-2.png" alt="" />

**#3 Analyze the file of interest (e.g., a suspicious mimiktaz.exe) and compare its timestamps.**

```

Any indicators like zeroed microseconds in the timestamps (e.g., `2020-01-01 06:30:00.0000000`), which hint that they were modified via the Windows API.

>üëâ Pro Tip: Timestamp values with all trailing zeros are very unusual and are a strong indicator of time stomping.

## üìÇ Case Example: Timestamp Mismatch Revealing the Truth

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve collected the `MFT` and are analyzing a suspicious binary named `mimiktaz.exe`. Here's what you observe:

<img src="/assets/img/mft-4.png" alt="" />

- `STANDARD INFORMATION` timestamps show `2020-01-01 06:30:00.0000000`

- `FILE NAME` timestamps show `2025-03-31 09:19:46.7950679`

The microseconds in `FILE NAME` look natural, while the `STANDARD INFORMATION` timestamps are all rounded. This tells us that someone manually altered the timestamp using a limited API.

üëâ **The mismatch between these two attributes is a key indicator of anti-forensic tampering.**

## üõ°Ô∏è Conclusion: Time Stomping Leaves Clues
Time stomping is a clever way for attackers to hide in plain sight. But they often overlook the redundant timestamp storage in NTFS. By analyzing the MFT and comparing multiple timestamp sources, forensic analysts can detect even subtle manipulations.

### üìå TL;DR
- Attackers drop malware in system folders and use time stomping to make it look old.
- NTFS stores multiple timestamp attributes some of which are harder to modify.
- Tools like `MFTECmd` can reveal timestamp mismatches that point to tampering.
- Rounded timestamps with all **zeros = suspicious**.
- Always compare `STANDARD INFORMATION` vs `FILE NAME`!

If you're doing a forensic investigation on NTFS systems, don't trust timestamps at face value. Dig deeper‚Äîand you'll often find the truth hidden in plain sight.
